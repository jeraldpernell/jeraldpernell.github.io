<p40>About Us</p40>

<p2>In 2015, Stuffin Muffin opened its first bakery location in Chicago, Illinois. Stuffin Muffin is known as a bakery with a unique selection of round gluten free muffin. We take pride in using natural ingredients like blueberrys, cranberrys, apples, and oranges in our muffins. Our treats are as deliciously wholesome as they are beautifully decorated. Choose from our signature muffins, weekly and holiday specials or custom created desserts.</p2>

<p3>Patrons are also invited to place pickup orders for select products through our online store. We are also pleased to offer nationwide shipping for a variety of products, including freshly baked muffins, as well as corporate gift packages and seasonal assortments.  
General Inquiries: info@stuffinmuffin.com (Please note that we cannot accept orders via email at this time. If interested in placing an order, please call 1.855.SMUFIN). </p3>
